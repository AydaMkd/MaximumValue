# MaximumValue
This is a simple application that allows you to enter values of an array of integers and check the maximum one. It has got two branches, main branch to run it on the browser, where I utilized HTML and Javascript, the main branch is also deployed to github pages. You can also check it on this link: https://aydamkd.github.io/maximumvalue/ 

The second branch that I called "server" lets it run on the server on node.js. To have it run on localhost, run "git checkout server" in your terminal, then "npm install" to install the required dependencies, then it should work by running "node index.js" or using nodemon.
